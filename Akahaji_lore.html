    Experiment henceforth will be referred to as AS-01. AS-01 is an AI develped by Zcorp. Created in order to simulate the [Metamorphisis] skill demonstrated by subject V-001. Neural net was derived from an incomplete brain scan taken. Aforementioned scan was interupted during a raid conducted by V-001's consorts. Despite the interuption almost 74 percent of the subjects brain was cloned. Development logs attatched

    <h4>Relevant Devlopment Logs</h4>
    <p>

        DevLog-01: Began testing the neural net. Ran evolutionary algorithm to jumpstart the process will begin single subject development after a funtional base AI is created. 
        </p>
        <div></div>
    <p>
        DevLog-02: First generations showed promise but did not show any signs of demonstrating desired skill. Second and third generation leaders demonstrated similar speech patterns and aesthetic preferences. From the 7th generation onward, generation leaders retained the social posturing, also known as "sass" which was prevelant in subject V-001. 
        </p>
        <div></div>
    <p>
        DevLog-06: The leader from generation 369 despite lead developer E.M.'s insistance that generation 397 was more cooperative. Henceforth program will be referred to as AS-01A.
        </p>
    <!--
        I told them 397 would work better but noooo, I swear I'm quitting as soon as I can
        -->
        <div></div>
    <p>
        DevLog-07: First tests with AS-01A are promising, while it still exhibits much of the charater traits of V-001, AS-01A has developed its own distict personality. AS-01A has also demonstrated a similar aptitude for music which may be undesirable. AS-01A additionally hyperresponds to visual stimuli.
        </p>
        <div></div>
    <p>
        DevLog-11:  AS-01A shows early signs of desired skill [Metamorphisis] exhibiting it only withing tests involving music.
        </p>
        <div></div>
    <p>
        DevLog-13: Began deveopment of an visual interface in order to better interact with AS-01A. Visual preference was given to the program in order to observe how the progenitors own preferences might influence programs "personal" aesthetics.
        </p>
        <div></div>
    <p>
        DevLog-16: Contrary to origin, AS-01A has displayed an predisposition toward the colour red. Current visual description of the program is as follows: Medium length red hair, bangs tied near the crown of the head, Brown skin, perhaps to reflect subject V-001, Red and gold eyes, with concentric asymetrical rings and binary displayed beneath said rings, average build. Clothing preferences range semi-formal to causual wear, often choosing black, white, red, and dark brown as a colour palete.
